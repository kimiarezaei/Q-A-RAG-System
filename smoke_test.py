"""
Lightweight sanity check — NOT an autograder.

Starts nothing itself; run your app first (docker compose up, or python app.py),
then run this in another shell:  python smoke_test.py

It checks three things against the response contract in the README:
  1. /health responds
  2. a grounded question returns an answer WITH a source
  3. an out-of-KB question DECLINES (empty sources)

Treat warnings as hints, not hard failures.
